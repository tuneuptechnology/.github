# Tuneup Technology

Tuneup Technology started as a mobile repair company of one in Utah, USA. Eventually we expanded to over a dozen technicians all over the state. Finding ourselves with the need to track customers, repairs, and inventory, we created what came to be known as the `TuneApp` which was a one-stop-shop for all things repair. Our technicians had everything they'd need to do their jobs at their disposal, online, 24/7.

We no longer operate our business or provide access to the TuneApp. The code here serves as a reference and placeholder should we ever decide to revisit our projects.
